## Planning & developmnet

## Agile Planning

The development of *Dog rescue center* was meticulously planned and executed following agile methodologies. This section outlines the user stories and epics that guided the development process, ensuring that each feature not only meets the users' expectations but also enriches their interaction with the app.

### Structuring Development with User Stories

At the heart of my agile planning were the User Stories - the narratives that captured the essence of what the users, both general visitors and registered members, sought from *Dog rescue center*. These stories facilitated a deep understanding of the audience's needs, guiding the development process from a user-centric perspective.

### Task Breakdown and Epic Creation

Each User Story sparked a series of tasks - specific, actionable steps designed to bring that story to life. 

### Prioritization with MoSCoW Method

To navigate the myriad of development tasks efficiently, I used the MoSCoW method of prioritization:

- **Must Have**: Core functionalities that were essential for the application's launch, such as the ability to view and interact with avaliable dogs.
- **Should Have**: .
- **Could Have**: Additional features that, while not critical, could further enrich the application, including enhanced styling and responsive design elements.
- **Won't Have (this time)**: Ideas that were put on hold for future development, allowing us to focus on the most impactful features first.

## Deployment

This section guides you through the deployment of an project on Heroku, including handling different branches and deployment preferences.

### Preparing for Deployment

Ensure your project includes a `requirements.txt` and a `Procfile`, which are essential for Heroku to understand how to run your application.

1. **requirements.txt**: Generate this file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to list all necessary Python packages.
2. **Procfile**: Create this file in your project's root directory with the content: `web: gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi`, replacing `your_project_name` with the name of your Django project.

### Deploying to Heroku

1. **Create a Heroku Account**: Sign up at [Heroku's website](https://signup.heroku.com/).
2. **Create a Heroku App**: Use `heroku create your-app-name`, substituting `your-app-name` with your desired app name.
3. **Set Config Vars**: Navigate to your app's settings on the Heroku dashboard, under "Config Vars", set:
    - `SECRET_KEY`: Your Django secret key.
    - `DATABASE_URL`: The database URL, typically provided by Heroku Postgres.
    - `CLOUDINARY_URL`: If using Cloudinary for media storage, your Cloudinary URL.

### Managing Branches and Deployment Options

1. **Branch Management**: If your development involves multiple branches, Heroku deploys from the main branch by default. To deploy from a different branch, use `git push heroku your-branch-name:main`, replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of your branch.

2. **Automatic vs. Manual Deployment**:
   - **Automatic Deployment**: In the Heroku dashboard, under the "Deploy" tab, you can connect your GitHub repository and enable automatic deploys from your chosen branch. This means any push to the selected branch automatically triggers a deployment.
   - **Manual Deployment**: If you prefer more control over when your changes go live, stick with manual deployments using the `git push heroku main` command for the main branch, or the appropriate branch name if deploying from a non-main branch.

3. **Deployment Preference**: You can switch between automatic and manual deployments based on your project's needs. For instance, automatic deployments are convenient for continuous delivery environments, while manual deployments offer more control for testing and final approvals before going live.

### Final Steps

1. **Run Migrations**: Execute `python3 manage.py makemigrations` `python3 manage.py migrate` to apply database migrations.
2. **Access Your App**: Open your app in a browser with `heroku open` or by visiting `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com`.

### Forking and Cloning (Optional)

- **Forking**: Click 'Fork' on the GitHub repository page to copy the project under your account.
- **Cloning**: Use `git clone copied-url` with the URL from the 'Code' button on GitHub to clone the repository for local development.

## Bugs


## Languages

- Python and the Django framework were used for backend development, data manipulation, and application logic.

- HTML was utilized to structure the content on web pages.

- CSS was employed for styling, including layout designs, colors, and fonts, to enhance the user interface.

- JavaScript may have been used to add interactive elements to the web pages, in conjunction with libraries or frameworks like Bootstrap for responsive design.

- SQL, through Django models, facilitated database management and operations, handling data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

- Django Template Language enabled dynamic data insertion into HTML, allowing for a seamless integration of backend and frontend elements.

This project showcases a full-stack web development approach, leveraging the strengths of each technology to create a comprehensive and interactive web application.
